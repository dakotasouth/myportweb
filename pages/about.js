                        My name is Dakota South. I am senior at the University of South Dakota
                    majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. I am an aspiring
                    Fullstack Software Engineer who is driven to learn and improve my skills 
                    every day.

                    One of my hobbies is competitive programming on websites like 
                    Leetcode and Kattis which led me to be the current president of my school's 
                    competitive programming club. Some of my most notable strengths that define me 
                    are futuristic, learner, positivity, and communication. These major traits
                    have molded me into the driven individual I am today.
